## Shameless Plug

I have made two landing page clone videos with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

-   SpaceX
-   Tesla

<Iframe videoID='HkOcmKGm0zU' />
<Iframe videoID='DwvJnDQgIIU' />

You will learn about:

-   Javascript intersection observer to add cool effects
-   DOM manipulation
-   Aligning elements with CSS positions.
-   How to make responsive websites.

These will be great projects to brush up on your front end skills.

If you are interested you can check the videos.

You can also demo the application form
