## What is SendInBlue?

SendInBlue is a mail service that allows you to send emails from your Node.js application.

## Get Sendinblue email api key

1. Go to [SendinBlue](https://www.sendinblue.com) and create an
   account.
2. Go to Dashboard and click on the top right-hand side dropdown.

3. Click on the **SMTP & API** tab.
4. Click on the `Create new API key` button.
5. Now we need to store the api key in an environment variable.

## Setup

- Install packages:

```bash
npm init -y
npm i dotenv sib-api-v3-sdk
```

- Create a file called `.env` and add the following lines:

```
API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

- Create a file called `index.js` and add the following lines:

```javascript
const Sib = require('sib-api-v3-sdk')

require('dotenv').config()

const client = Sib.ApiClient.instance

const apiKey = client.authentications['api-key']
apiKey.apiKey = process.env.API_KEY
```

Explanation: - `require('dotenv').config()`: This is used to load the environment variables from the `.env` file. Then we have to add the api key to the Sendinblue client.

```javascript
const tranEmailApi = new Sib.TransactionalEmailsApi()

const sender = {
	email: 'thatanjan@gmail.com',
	name: 'Anjan',
}

const receivers = [
	{
		email: '<email address>',
	},
]
```

Explanation: With `tranEmailApi` we can send emails. The sender email has to be the email account that you have used in the SendinBlue account.

```javascript
tranEmailApi
	.sendTransacEmail({
		sender,
		to: receivers,
		subject: 'Subscribe to Cules Coding to become a developer',
		textContent: `
        Cules Coding will teach you how to become {{params.role}} a developer.
        `,
		htmlContent: `
        <h1>Cules Coding</h1>
        <a href="https://cules-coding.vercel.app/">Visit</a>
                `,
		params: {
			role: 'Frontend',
		},
	})
	.then(console.log)
	.catch(console.log)
```

Explanation:

- You can send emails using the `sendTransacEmail` method.
- Subject is required.
- You have to pass either `textContent` or `htmlContent` to the method. `htmlContent` will override `textContent`.
- You can pass parameters to the email content using the `params`
  object.

- Run the file and you will see the email was sent.

```bash
node index.js
```
