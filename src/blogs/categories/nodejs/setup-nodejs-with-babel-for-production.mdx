The features that this project will have.

- Absolute import path
- Older nodeJs version compatibility
- Automatic restart of the server after any changes in the development environment.

I have made a video about this topic. Watch the video to grasp the concepts.

Alright. Enough Talk. Let's get started.

First, I will create a folder called nodejs-setup. Then inside the folder, I will initialize the package.json

```bash
mkdir nodejs-setup
cd nodejs-setup
yarn init -y
```

Now we need to install some packages. Let's install our only dependency.

```bash
yarn add express
```

Let's install some dev dependency.

```bash
yarn add --dev @babel/cli @babel/core @babel/node @babel/preset-env babel-plugin-module-resolver nodemon
```

Let's explore the devDependencies:

- @babel/core: Babel is a transcompiler that compiles js code based on the given configuration. The babel does not do anything. Plugins do.
- babel-plugin-module-resolver: This plugin allows us to write an absolute path instead of a relative path. Let's see a demo.

```javascript
// Use Absolute path:
import MyUtilFn from 'utils/MyUtilFn'
// Instead of Relative path:
import MyUtilFn from '../../../../utils/MyUtilFn'
```

- @babel/preset-env: Preset is a combination of a bunch of plugins. This preset will allow us to use next-generation javascript code. Then it will be compiled down to browser and nodejs compatible code. It also adds many features.

- nodemon: nodemon is a tool to restart the server automatically whenever we change our source code so that we don't have to do it manually.

let's write some code.
I will create an `src` folder where I will store all of my source files. Inside src create a file called `index.js`

```bash
mkdir src
touch index.js
```

Let's create a simple express server.

```javascript
//index.js

import express from 'express'

const app = express()

app.get('/hello', (req, res) => res.send('hello world from cules coding'))

const port = process.env.PORT || 8000

app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Server is running on ${port}`))
```

Let's write some scripts in our package.json file.

```json
// packagejson

{
	"name": "nodejs-setup",
	"version": "1.0.0",
	"main": "index.js",
	"license": "MIT",
	"dependencies": {
		"express": "^4.17.1"
	},
	"devDependencies": {
		"@babel/cli": "^7.13.0",
		"@babel/core": "^7.13.8",
		"@babel/node": "^7.13.0",
		"@babel/preset-env": "^7.13.9",
		"babel-plugin-module-resolver": "^4.1.0",
		"nodemon": "^2.0.7"
	}
}
```

scripts:

```JSON
{
	"scripts": {
		"dev": "nodemon --exec babel-node src/index.js",
		"build": "babel  src -d build",
		"start": "yarn build && node build/index.js"
	}
}
```

Let's explore the scripts:

- dev: This script will be used to start the development server. `nodemon` will automatically start the server when our code changes. But even before that `nodemon` will execute `babel-node` and will compile the `src/index.js` file.
- build: This script will be used for `production`. `babel` will compile our code from the `src` folder to the build directory. `babel` will automatically create a build directory for you if it does not exist.
- start: I will first run our build script. Then it will start our node server from the build directory.

If I show you the compiled code:

```javascript
'use strict'

var _express = _interopRequireDefault(require('express'))

function _interopRequireDefault(obj) {
	return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { default: obj }
}

var app = (0, _express['default'])()
app.get('/hello', function (req, res) {
	return res.send('hello world from cules coding')
})
var port = process.env.PORT || 8000
app.listen(port, function () {
	return console.log('Server is running on '.concat(port))
})
```

And that's how you can set up a nodejs project for `development` and `production`.


## Shameless Plug

I have already made a Redux toolkit crash course on my youtube channel. Redux toolkit is a tool to set up and wok with  redux easily
