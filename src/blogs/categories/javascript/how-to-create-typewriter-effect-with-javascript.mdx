In this blog, I will show you how to create a typewriter effect with JavaScript.

## Typewriter Effect Demo

<Codepen id='GROrRQJ'/>

## Basic Idea

We will have an `h1` tag. It will contain the text `I am a`. Then we will have a word with the typewriter effect.
We will take each of the characters and put them in a span tag. Then we will put that span tag inside the `h1` tag.
We will do this for each character. After completing the word, we will wait for a while and then start removing the character.
After removing the whole word, we will wait for a while and then start adding the next word.
This is how we will create the typewriter effect.

## Html

```html
<body>
	<h1 class="text">I am a&nbsp;</h1>
</body>
```

`a&nbsp;` is an HTML entity for non-breaking space.

## Css

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Cousine:wght@700&display=swap');

* {
	padding: 0;
	margin: 0;
	box-sizing: border-box;
}

html {
	font-size: 62.5%;
}

body {
	font-family: 'Cousine', monospace;
	min-height: 100vh;
	display: grid;
	place-items: center;
	background-color: black;
}

:root {
	--text-color: white;
}

.text {
	font-size: 4rem;
	display: inline-block;
	letter-spacing: 0.2rem;
	color: var(--text-color);
	border-right: 1rem solid var(--text-color);
	animation: blink 0.5s step-end infinite alternate;
}

.char {
	color: orange;
}

@keyframes blink {
	50% {
		border-color: transparent;
	}
}

@media (min-width: 600px) {
	.text {
		font-size: 6rem;
	}
}

@media (min-width: 900px) {
	.text {
		font-size: 8rem;
	}
}

@media (min-width: 1200px) {
	.text {
		font-size: 11rem;
	}
}

@media (min-width: 1600px) {
	.text {
		font-size: 14rem;
	}
}
```

Basic css for the website.

## Javascript

```javascript
const textEl = document.querySelector('.text')

const words = ['Developer', 'Youtuber', 'Blogger'].map(word => word + '.')

let wordIndex = 0
let charIndex = 0

let addingChars = true
let shouldWait = false

let currentWord = words[wordIndex]
```

Explanation:

- `textEl` is the `h1` tag.
- `words` is an array of words that will have the typewriter effect.
- `wordIndex` is the index of the current word.
- `charIndex` is the index of the current character.
- `addingChars` is a boolean that tells us if we are adding characters or removing them.
- `shouldWait` is a boolean that tells us if we should wait for a while.
- `currentWord` is the current word that we are working on.

```javascript
const addChar = () => {
	let currChar = currentWord[charIndex]

	const char = document.createElement('span')

	char.innerText = currChar
	char.classList.add('char')

	textEl.appendChild(char)

	charIndex++

	if (charIndex === currentWord.length) {
		charIndex--
		addingChars = false
		shouldWait = true
	}
}
```

Explanation:

- `currChar` is the current character. We put them in a span tag and them inside the `textEl` element.
- We increase the `charIndex` by 1.
- If the `charIndex` is equal to the length of the current word, we decrement `charIndex` by 1. Because we have to start removing from the last character.
- We set `addingChars` to false and `shouldWait` to true. Because we have to wait for a while.

```javascript
const removeChar = () => {
	const char = textEl.lastElementChild

	textEl.removeChild(char)

	charIndex--

	if (charIndex < 0) {
		charIndex++
		addingChars = true
		updateCurrWord()
	}
}
```

Explanation :

- We remove the last child of the `textEl` element and decrease the `charIndex` by 1.
- If the `charIndex` is less than 0, we increase it by 1. Because we have to start adding from the first character to the next word.
- We set `addingChars` to true and `shouldWait` to false. Because we have to add the next word.
- And we call the `updateCurrWord` function. Let's implement the `updateCurrWord` function.

```javascript
const updateCurrWord = () => {
	wordIndex++

	if (wordIndex === words.length) wordIndex = 0

	currentWord = words[wordIndex]
}
```

Explanation:

- We increase the `wordIndex` by 1.
- If the `wordIndex` is equal to the length of the words array, we set `wordIndex` to 0. Because we have to start from the first word.
- Finally, we update the `currentWord` to the current index.

```javascript
const runTypewriter = () => {
	const operation = addingChars ? addChar : removeChar

	operation()

	let timeout = addingChars ? 200 : 100

	if (shouldWait) {
		timeout = 1000
		shouldWait = false
	}

	setTimeout(runTypewriter, timeout)
}

setTimeout(runTypewriter, 1500)
```

Explanation:

- We create an `operation` variable. It will store the function that we want to call. It will be either `addChar` or `removeChar` depending on the `addingChars` variable.
- We create a `timeout` variable. It will store the time that we want to wait. It will be either `200` or `1000` depending on the `shouldWait` variable.
- If `shouldWait` is true, we set `timeout` to 1000 and `shouldWait` to false.
- We call the `runTypewriter` function inside the `typewriter` function. This is what we call `recursion`. But don't worry about it. It will create a loop that will create the typewriter effect.
- Finally, we call the `runTypewriter` function globally after 1500 milliseconds.
