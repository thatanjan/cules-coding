In this blog, you will learn everything you need to know about javascript destructuring.

I have already created a video about it on my youtube channel. Check that out for more details.

### Why does Destructuring exist in javascript?


Because it solves our problem. Let's see an example.

This is a normal object containing the names of 4 people.

```javascript
const names = {
	taylor: 'Taylor Swift',
	shawn: 'Shawn Mendes',
	zayn: 'Zayn Malik',
	halsey: 'Halsey',
}
```

Now if I ask you to print all the file names manually to the console, how would you do that. Possibly like this:

```javascript
console.log(names.taylor)
console.log(names.shawn)
console.log(names.zayn)
console.log(names.halsey)
```

It works. But it is so annoying to use this dot notation. But how can we make this better?

```javascript
const taylor = names.taylor
const shawn = names.shawn
const zayn = names.zayn
const halsey = names.halsey

console.log(taylor)
console.log(shawn)
console.log(zayn)
console.log(halsey)
```

Much better. But we are still repeating the same task. What if we can declare and assign the object properties on variables on a single?

It would be better right?. This is where Object destructuring helps us. So instead we can do something like this :

```javascript
const { taylor, shawn, zayn, halsey} = names

console.log(taylor)
console.log(shawn)
console.log(zayn)
console.log(halsey)
```

Wow! That is way better than before. 

### But, how is it working?

It is so simple. We are just pulling out the properties from the object and storing them in a variable. And the variable name will be the same as the property name by default. You can change that like this.

```javascript
const { taylor, shawn, zayn: zaynMalik, halsey} = names
```

### What about array destructuring?

Array destructuring works in a similar way with some differences. 
We know data are stored in an array with indexes. They are sequential. So, while destructuring you have to maintain the order. For example:

```javascript
const albums = ['Lover', 'Evermore', 'Red', 'Fearless']

const [lover, ever] = arr
```

And also arrays don't have a property for values. So, you can just give whatever variable name you want.

Let's see some use cases of Object destructuring and array destructuring.

### Array destrucutring
 - Swapping variables

<br  /> 

```javascript
let a = 1;
let b = 3;

[a, b] = [b, a];
console.log(a); // 3
console.log(b); // 1
```

- Ignoring some returned values

```javascript
function f() {
  return [1, 2, 3];
}

const [a, , b] = f();
console.log(a); // 1
console.log(b); // 3
```

- Default values

```javascript
let a, b;

[a=5, b=7] = [1];
console.log(a); // 1
console.log(b); // 7

```

- Create sub array with Rest parameters.
```javascript
const albums = ['Lover', 'Evermore', 'Red', 'Fearless']

const [, ...albums2] = albums

console.log(albums2) // ['Evermore', 'Red', 'Fearless']
```


### Object destrucutring

- Unpacking fields from objects passed as a function parameter

It is really useful for react props.

```
const anjan = {
	   	name: 'Anjan', age: 20
}

const statement = ({name, age}) => {
	   	return `My name is ${name}. I am ${age} years old.`
}

statement(anjan)

```

- Nested Object destructuring 

```javascript
const profile: { 
	   name: 'Anjan', 
	   age: 20,
	   professional: {
		  profession: 'Full Stack Software Engineer',
	   }
}

const {name, age, professional: {profession}} = profile

console.log(professional) // error
console.log(profession) // Full Stack Software Engineer
```

- Default values

<br  /> 

In any case, the property is `undefined`

```javascript
const {a = 10, b = 5} = {a: 3};

console.log(a); // 3
console.log(b); // 5
```


- Nested object and array destructuring

<br  /> 

```javascript
const taylor = {
	name: 'Taylor Swift',
	age: 31,
	address: {
		city: 'New York',
		country: 'USA',
	},
	albums: ['Lover', 'Evermore', 'Red', 'Fearless'],
}

const {
	name,
	age,
	address: { city },
	albums: [lover, ...rest],
} = taylor

console.log(name) // Taylor Swift
console.log(age) // 31
console.log(city) // New York
console.log(lover) // Lover
console.log(rest) // [ 'Evermore', 'Red', 'Fearless' ]
```


That's all you need to know about javascript destructuring.
