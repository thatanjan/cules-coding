In this blog, you will learn how to use Axios to make HTTP requests in JavaScript.

## What is Axios?

Axios is a library that makes it easy to make HTTP requests in
JavaScript. It is promise based. It is much more browser compatible
than fetch API because it uses XMLHttpRequest behind the scenes.
You can also use Axios in Node.js.

https://github.com/axios/axios

<!-- You can learn about fetch API from here. -->

## How to use Axios?

You can install Axios using npm or yarn.

```bash
npm install axios
# or
yarn add axios
```

or you can use CDN.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
```

We will use [ReqRes API](https://reqres.in/) for testing. It gives you
fake data to test your code.

## How to make a GET request?

We will fetch some users from ReqRes API.

```javascript
const url = 'https://reqres.in/api'
const getUsers = async () => {
	const result = await axios.get(`${url}/users/`)

	console.log(result)
}

getUsers()
```

Explanation:

- You will get a response object. The response is already parsed as JSON.
- It has a data property. The data property is holding the data.

## Pass query parameter

```javascript
const url = 'https://reqres.in/api'
const getUsers = async () => {
	const result = await axios.get(`${url}/users/`, {
		params: {
			per_page: 10,
		},
	})

	// or
	// const result = await axios.get(`${url}/users?per_page=10`)

	console.log(result)
}

getUsers()
```

## How to make a POST request?

We will send a POST request to ReqRes API to create a new user. It
will not create a new user. It will only mimic the process and return
us a response.

```javascript
const url = 'https://reqres.in/api'

const createUser = async () => {
	const result = await axios.post(`${url}/users`, {
		name: 'Anjan',
		job: 'Developer',
	})
	console.log(result)
}
```

Explanation:

- You can pass a request body as a second parameter which will contain data about the user.
- You will get a response object. The response is already parsed as JSON.

## Config object

You can pass a config object to axios. Learn more from the [ docs ](https://github.com/axios/axios#request-config).

## Request headers

Let's see how we can pass a request header. We are passing an `Authorization` header which normally holds the user's token.

```javascript
const url = 'https://reqres.in/api'

const createUser = async () => {
	const config = {
		headers: {
			Authorization: 'token',
		},
	}

	const result = await axios.post(
		`${url}/users`,
		{
			name: 'Anjan',
			job: 'Developer',
		},
		config
	)

	console.log(result)
}

createUser()
```

## Axios instance

Our URL was always the same and we are passing it manually to every
request. But we can create an instance of Axios which will have the
URL from the start. and use it to make requests. You can also store
other configs like request headers.

```javascript
const url = 'https://reqres.in/api'

const instance = axios.create({
	baseURL: url,
	headers: {
		Authorization: 'token',
	},
})

const getUsers = async () => {
	const result = await instance.get(`/users`, {
		params: {
			per_page: 10,
		},
	})
	console.log(result)
}
```

Now we can use the instance to make requests. We are just only passing the endpoints not the whole URL.

## Axios transform the response

You can transform the response data using the transformResponse property in config.

```javascript
const createUser = async () => {
	const config = {
		headers: {
			Authorization: 'dfdkfj',
		},

		transformResponse: axios.defaults.transformResponse.concat(data => {
			data.modified = 'modified'

			return data
		}),
	}

	const result = await axios.post(
		`${url}/users`,
		{
			name: 'Anjan',
			job: 'Developer',
		},
		config
	)
	console.log(result)
}
```

Explanation:

- `transformResponse` takes an array of functions that will be called on the response data one after another.
- It will override the default transformResponse functions. I don't
  recommend that. Instead, we can extend the default transformResponse
  with our functions.
- We are using the `concat` method of the array to add our functions.
