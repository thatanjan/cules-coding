I tried material-UI for the first time back in 2020 for one of my projects. From then I have become a fan of it. It is really beautiful and elegant.  Material UI has everything that you need for a modern website.  

### Now why would you want to use a UI framework instead of custom CSS styling?

The reason might be: 

- You are not good at CSS or you don't like it.
- CSS from scratch is too much work.
- You are in a hurry.
- You are terrible at design and so on...

Let's see 10 reasons why you should try material-UI:

1. Beautiful design: Material-UI is based on Material Design. And It is developed by Google. It is also a well tested design by professionals. And it is so beautiful. If you have visited any kind of google website, you will find a common design.

This is material design. It is clean, colors are good for the eyes, and nice animations.

2. Huge amount of Components: Material-UI has a huge amount of components. It has everything that you need. You can create simple to complex websites easily.

3. CSS in JS: It simply means writing your CSS styles with javascript but with much more flexibility. It gives you unique class names. You can use them for making the styles scoped to the component.

4. Customizable: You can customize Material-UI however you want. You can use custom CSS with makeStyles. Or you can customize the whole theme. You can change every style of any class.

5. Grid System: This is my favorite feature of this framework. You can create a complex responsive layout with Material-UI Grid.

6. Icons: Material-UI comes with over 1000 icons. They are customizable.

7. Tree Shaking: It removes all the unused code from the package for the production build. That's how websites can load faster.

8. Great Docs: Material-UI docs are one of the best docs I have ever seen. It has everything that you need to know.

9. TypeScript support: Material-UI supports typescript out of the box. 

10. Great Community: Material-UI is very popular and it has a large and great community. If you face any problem, the community members will try their best to help you.

So, these are the reasons why I love Material-UI.

That's it for today. I will see you in the next blog.

Until then, stay safe and be happy.
