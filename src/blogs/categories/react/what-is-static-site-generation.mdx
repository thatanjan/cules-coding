## What does Static mean?

Static means things that don't change. A static website's content doesn't change. For example, if you have a blog, you don't change the blog content much. So, the website's content doesn't change. That's why it will be a static site.
If the content changes, it will be a dynamic site like a social media website.

## How does our web work?

We have to understand how our web works. Take a look at the following image.

- We have a client(normally a browser) and a server.
- Client sends a request for an HTML page for example `blog.html`.
- The server creates the blog.html file.
- Now the `blog.html` file might need some external data like from a database or an API. So, the server fetches data from the sources and builds the HTML file with the fetched data.
- Then the server sends that back to the client as a response.

This is what we call Server-side rendering. If you want to learn more about server-side rendering, you can watch the following video.

Also, you can learn about the client-side rendering from the following video.

## Problem with Server-side rendering

Every time the client sends a request to the server, the whole process starts again. And it makes sense.
But it can be slow in one scenario. Suppose, the data that needs to fetch on request time rarely changes.
For example, if you write a blog, you don't change the blog content much. So, the website's content doesn't change.
It will be unnecessary to fetch the same data from the database every time the client sends a request.

## How does static site generation solve this problem?

Instead of fetching data on request time, we can fetch the data on build time and put the data in the HTML file.
So, now if the client sends a request, the server will immediately send the HTML file back to the client. Because the HTML file is already created with the required data.
So, you don't need to do the extra process which makes the website super fast.

## What is Static Site Generation?

So, Static site generation is a process of generating static webpages at the build time. Static sites are getting more and more popular.

## How to use static site generation?

You can use some kind of front-end frameworks like Gatsby, Next.js, Jekyll, etc. You can check [the link](https://jamstack.org/generators/) for more details.

## Pros of static site generation

- It's fast.
- No need of backend.
- It's SEO friendly.
- Easy to scale.
- Free hosting with github page, netlify, vercel, etc.

## When to use static site generation?

Static sites are great when the content doesn't change. If your content changes often, then static site generation is not the best option.
