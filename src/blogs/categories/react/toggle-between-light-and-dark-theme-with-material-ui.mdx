I have already created a video about it on my youtube channel. Check that out. 
<Iframe videoID="ag3je1g0BN8" title="Easily toggle between light and dark theme with Material-UI" /> 

We know that in dark mode, the background stays dark and the foreground is white to keep the contrast. In light mode, it is just the opposite. 
So, we need a component that automatically changes its background color based on the theme. Also for the text.

In Material-ui, we have a component like that. That is the Paper component.  The Paper component is intelligent enough to automatically detect the theme and it will change its background color. For more information, please check their docs out. [Paper](https://material-ui.com/components/paper/#paper)

- Let's create a boilerplate component.

```javascript
import React from 'react'

const DarkTheme = (props) => {
	return (
		<div>
			
		</div>
	)
}

export default DarkTheme
```

- Create a new state with useState hook.
```javascript
import React, {useState} from 'react'

const DarkTheme = (props) => {
	const [dark, setDark] = useState(false)
	return (
		<div>
			
		</div>
	)
}

export default DarkTheme
```

This will be used for checking if the current mode is in dark or not.

- Create a new theme.

```javascript
import React, {useState} from 'react'
import { createMuiTheme, ThemeProvider } from '@material-ui/core/styles'

const DarkTheme = (props) => {
	const [dark, setDark] = useState(false)

	const theme = createMuiTheme({
		palette: {
			type: dark ? 'dark' : 'light',
		},
	})

	return (
		<div>
			
		</div>
	)
}

export default DarkTheme

```

Simply we specify the theme mode by the type property. In this case, it will be updated based on the `dark` state value. We will use a button to manipulate the state.

- Insert a paper with the Typography component.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { createMuiTheme, ThemeProvider } from '@material-ui/core/styles'
import Typography from '@material-ui/core/Typography'
import Paper from '@material-ui/core/Paper'

const DarkTheme = () => {
	const [dark, setDark] = useState(false)

	const theme = createMuiTheme({
		palette: {
			type: dark ? 'dark' : 'light',
		},
	})

	return (
			<Paper>
				<Typography variant='h1'>This is a h1 text</Typography>

				<Typography variant='body2'>This is a body2 text</Typography>
			</Paper>
	)
}

export default DarkTheme
```

- Wrap all components by the ThemeProvider and pass the theme object as a theme prop. 

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { createMuiTheme, ThemeProvider } from '@material-ui/core/styles'
import Typography from '@material-ui/core/Typography'
import Paper from '@material-ui/core/Paper'

const DarkTheme = () => {
	const [dark, setDark] = useState(false)

	const theme = createMuiTheme({
		palette: {
			type: dark ? 'dark' : 'light',
		},
	})

	return (
		<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
			<Paper>
				<Typography variant='h1'>This is a h1 text</Typography>

				<Typography variant='body2'>This is a body2 text</Typography>
			</Paper>
		</ThemeProvider>
	)
}

export default DarkTheme
```

If you have no idea about theming in material-ui, then please check this video out.

ThemeProvider is making our custom theme available to all the children. It is like redux and context API.

But we still don't have the toggle functionality. We need a switch component

- Insert a switch component or any other button-type component that can be togglable.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { createMuiTheme, ThemeProvider } from '@material-ui/core/styles'
import Typography from '@material-ui/core/Typography'
import Paper from '@material-ui/core/Paper'
import Switch from '@material-ui/core/Switch'

const DarkTheme = () => {
	const [dark, setDark] = useState(false)

	const theme = createMuiTheme({
		palette: {
			type: dark ? 'dark': 'light',
		},
	})

	return (
		<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
			<Switch checked={dark} onChange={() => setDark(!dark)} />
			<Paper>
				<Typography variant='h1'>This is a h1 text</Typography>

				<Typography variant='body2'>This is a body2 text</Typography>
			</Paper>
		</ThemeProvider>
	)
}

export default DarkTheme
```

Every time you click on the switch button, the dark state will be changed to its opposite value. This will toggle the theme type.

- Switch off.

- Switch on.

#### How is it working?
The Paper component has a white Background color and dark font color. And Typography component by default inherits the font color from its parent. In this case, it is the Paper component. 
When the theme type is changed, Paper is intelligent enough to detect the change. It will invert the color to keep the contrast between foreground and background color.

So, This is how it works. Isn't it so easy?
