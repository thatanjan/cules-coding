In this blog, I will teach you, how to set up eslint, prettier with TypeScript and React. Even if you are not using TypeScript or react you can still follow along.

I have already created a video about it on my youtube channel. Check that out for more details.

For react, I will use Nextjs. Again the principles are the same. You can also use it with create-react-app.

## Editor setup
You need to install eslint and prettier plugins for your editor. To learn more, visit these links.
[ Eslint ](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations#editors)
[Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html)


## Setup
```bash
yarn create-next-app
```

Then put your app name. I am going to call it `eslint-prettier-typescript-react`

After that, it will set everything for you.

Now change the directory to the folder.

```bash
cd eslint-prettier-typescript-react
```

### TypeScript setup for Nextjs (optional)

Create a `tsconfig.json` file.

```bash
touch tsconfig.json
```

Install typescript packages.

```bash
yarn add --dev typescript @types/react
```

Then start the server.

```bash
yarn dev
```

It will fill up the `tsconfig.json` file. Now convert all the javascript files to typescript files.

### Setup Absolute import
Absolute Import vs Relative Import

Inside the `tsconfig.json` file. create a new property `baseUrl` and set the import point. I will create an `src` folder and put all source code inside that.

So add this extra code: 
```json
{
	"baseUrl": "src/"
	"include": ["next-env.d.ts", "**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx", "src/"],
}
```

### Setup eslint
- Install eslint globally on your computer.
```bash
	yarn global add eslint
```

- Inside your project initialize eslint.
```bash
	eslint --init
```
- Choose 3.

- Choose 1

- Choose your framework if you are using it. In my case `react`

![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/aw6b38hxdgjgrqp1d0jt.png)

- If you are using TypeScript then `yes`. I am using TypeScript.

- Browser in my case.

![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iql056fynfoz6390k4m7.png)

- Use a popular style guide.

- I would like to use the Airbnb style guide. You can choose any style guide. But Airbnb is good and I recommend it.

![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jk8bfygud485tck9hh3c.png)

- I will use json for my config file.

![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ntnjtfvmpvnwbbyffp64.png)

- It will ask you to install some packages to Install with `npm`. If you want to use `npm` then go ahead. But I will use yarn. 

![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q8u06509o0ztw7h3mlag.png)

So For those who are using yarn like me, You can copy and paste package names and install them.

##### With typescript: 

```bash
yarn add --dev eslint-plugin-react @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin@latest eslint-config-airbnb@latest eslint eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-plugin-react-hooks  @typescript-eslint/parser@latest
```

##### Without typescript: 

```bash
yarn add --dev eslint-plugin-react  eslint-config-airbnb@latest eslint eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-plugin-react-hooks  
```
It will create an eslint config file `.eslintrc`. It will be a hidden file.


### Prettier Setup

- Let's install prettier.
```bash
yarn add --dev eslint-config-prettier prettier
```

- Create a prettier config file.
```ash 
touch .prettierrc.json
```

Now you can put your config in the `.prettierrc.json` file in json format. You can find the options from [here](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html)

My basic config for prettier.
```json
	{
		"singleQuote": true,
		"useTabs": true,
		"tabWidth": 1,
		"semi": false,
		"jsxSingleQuote": true,
		"arrowParens": "avoid"
	}
```

Now we are done with prettier. Let's set up eslint config.

### ESlint config setup

Your `.eslintrc` file should look like this.
```json
	{
	    "env": {
		   "browser": true,
		   "es2021": true
	    },
	    "extends": [
		   "plugin:react/recommended",
		   "airbnb"
	    ],
	    "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser",
	    "parserOptions": {
		   "ecmaFeatures": {
			  "jsx": true
		   },
		   "ecmaVersion": 12,
		   "sourceType": "module"
	    },
	    "plugins": [
		   "react",
		   "@typescript-eslint"
	    ],
	    "rules": {
	    }
	}
```

We need to extend the eslint config with prettier. So add `prettier` to `extends` array.
```json
	{
		"extends": [
		   "plugin:react/recommended",
		   "airbnb",
		   "prettier" 
	    ],
	}
```

###### Let's fix some eslint errors

To turn any rule `off` or `on`, add the rules to the rules array. You can find the docs from [here](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/rules). Please watch my video to understand it well.

- allow jsx on other extensions.

```json
	{
		"rules": {
			"react/jsx-filename-extension": [
					1, { "extensions": [".js", ".jsx", ".ts", ".tsx"] }
			]
		}
	}
```


- File extension on import statement.

```json
{
	"rules": {
			"import/extensions": [
				"error",
				"always",
				{
					"js": "never",
					"jsx": "never",
					"ts": "never",
					"tsx": "never"
				}
			],
		}
}
```

- Import unresolved error for absolute import(if you are using).
```json 
	{
		"settings": {
			"import/resolver": {
				"node": {
					"extensions": [".js", ".jsx", ".ts", ".tsx"],
					"moduleDirectory": ["node_modules", "src/"]
				}
			}
		}
	}
```

You can find my Eslint config from [here](https://gist.github.com/thatanjan/c3c2622e0360ecacb7aba9c7418023a1)

So, that's it for today. I hope I have covered everything that you need to know about how to set up.
