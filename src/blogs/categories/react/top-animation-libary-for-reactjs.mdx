- Framer Motion
  ![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p70wuamob4fyjpcy47c2.png)

Motion shares the simple animation and gesture API as the Framer library while maintaining HTML and SVG semantics.
This makes it simple to port your high-fidelity prototypes to a production-ready environment, or make something completely new!

- React Spring
  ![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1jnoc0viev3ft73fgr9r.jpg)

React-spring is a spring-physics based animation library that should cover most of your UI-related animation needs. It gives you tools flexible enough to confidently cast your ideas into moving interfaces.

- React Transition Group

Exposes simple components useful for defining entering and exciting transitions. React Transition Group is not an animation library like React-Motion, it does not animate styles by itself. Instead, it exposes transition stages, manages classes and group elements, and manipulates the DOM in useful ways, making the implementation of actual visual transitions much easier
