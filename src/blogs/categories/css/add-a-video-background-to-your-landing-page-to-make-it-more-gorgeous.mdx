### Starter code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="UTF-8" />
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
		<title>Taylor Swift</title>
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="nav.css" />
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="content.css" />
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="responsive.css" />
	</head>
	<body>
		This is body

		<script src="index.js"></script>
	</body>
</html>
```

### Let's add the video and overlay to html.

```html
<section class="video_container">
	<video src="./media/background.mp4" autoplay loop muted></video>
	<div class="overlay"></div>
</section>
```

Result:
![video with no style - Add video background to your landing page to make it more gorgeous by cules coding ](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vjzp8464atlc7x38y8p4.png)

Explanation:

- A video container to contain the video and overlay.
- Video will be started automatically with a loop. It will also be muted.

### Css reset

```CSS
* {
	padding: 0;
	margin: 0;
	box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
	max-width: 100vw;
	overflow-x: hidden;
}
```

Explanation:

- The entire webpage should not be bigger than the screen width.
- Webpage will not have any horizontal scrolling.

### Let's style the video:

```css
.video_container {
	min-height: 100vh;
	max-height: 100vh;
	overflow: hidden;
	position: relative;
}

.video_container video {
	position: absolute;
	left: 0;
	top: 0;
	width: 100%;
	height: 100%;
	object-fit: cover;
	object-position: center;
}
```

Result:
![video styled but no overlay - Add video background to your landing page to make it more gorgeous by Cules Coding ](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/recuxoyiwft08256si2u.png)

Explanation:

- The video container is taking the full width of the screen without any overflow. It is also positioned as `relative`.
- Actual video is positioned `absolute` and aligned with the container. It is also taking the full height and width.

If you have confusion with Css position then you can watch this video.

<Iframe  videoID='tO2KjMlor4o'/>

- To make the video fit, we need to use `object-fit` to `cover`.
- If the user adjusts screen width, the user will always see the center of the video because of `object-position: center;`.

### Let's style the overlay.

```css
:root {
	--primary-red: #70000e;
}

.overlay {
	position: absolute;
	left: 0;
	top: 0;
	width: 100%;
	height: 100%;
	background: var(--primary-red);
	mix-blend-mode: soft-light;
}
```

Result:
![with overlay](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/z4llmdtpsn2c1u224dfi.png)

Explanation:

- Overlay element is aligned with the container using position `absolute`.
- The background color is stored inside a variable. If you don't know about css variable, then you can check out this [blog](https://www.culescoding.space/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-css-variables)
- Overlay has been blended with the background using a blend mode. We need to use `mix-blend-mode` property to do so. I will use `soft-light` as value. You can learn about `mix-blend-mode` from [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode)

And that's how you add a video background to a landing page to make it more gorgeous. If you want to learn how the rest of the project was made please watch the video.
