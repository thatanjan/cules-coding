To apply CSS position you need to use the `position` property. 
4 property to manipulate the position.
  - top
  - bottom
  - left
  - right

There are 5 types of CSS positions.


## Static

The static position is the default behavior. It is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page.

Note: header should be `static`. Sorry for my mistake.

```html
  <h1>static</h1>
  <div class="outer__parent">outer parent
    <div class="parent">parent
	 <div class="children">children</div>
    </div>
  </div>
```

```CSS
  * {
    color: #fff;
  }
  h1 {
    color: #000;
    font-size: 2rem;
    margin-bottom: 2rem;
  }
  .outer__parent {
    background: #00f;
    width: 50vw;
    height: 50vh;
    padding: 1rem;
    font-size: 1.5rem;
  }
  .parent {
    background: #f00;
    height: 30vh;
    margin-top: 1rem;
  }
  .children {
    background: #0ff;
    height: 10vh;
    color: #000;
    margin-top: 1rem;
  }

```

## Relative
The relative position is almost the same as the Static position. But you can change the position from its normal position with the 4properties mentioned above.

```css
  .children {
    background: #0ff;
    height: 10vh;
    color: #000;
    margin-top: 1rem;
    position: relative;
    top: 20px;
    left: 300px;
  }

```

## Absolute
Unlike the `relative` position, it will be positioned relative to its nearest relative parent. If it doesn't find any, then it will be positioned to document the body. It will be removed from the flow of the webpage. It will be also be scrolled with other elements.

 without relative parent
```css
  .children {
    background: #0ff;
    height: 10vh;
    color: #000;
    margin-top: 1rem;
    position: absolute;
    top: 20px;
    left: 300px;
  }

```

with relative parent
```css 
  .parent {
    background: #f00;
    height: 30vh;
    margin-top: 1rem;
    position: relative;
  }
  .children {
    background: #0ff;
    height: 10vh;
    color: #000;
    margin-top: 1rem;
    position: absolute;
    top: 20px;
    left: 300px;
  }

```

## Fixed
`fixed` is similar to `absolute` with some difference. It will be positioned relative to the document body. It will stay fixed inside the viewport and will never be scrolled.

```css
  .children {
    background: #0ff;
    height: 10vh;
    color: #000;
    margin-top: 1rem;
    position: fixed;
    top: 20px;
    left: 15%;
  }
```

## Sticky
A sticky element toggles between `relative` and `fixed`. It will stay at `relative` first. When it will be scrolled down or up, it will meet an offset(the position that you will give). Then it turns it to fix. If the parent is passed from the viewport it will also be scrolled. If the parent is the document body. Then it will always stay fixed.

  margin-top: 1rem;
  position: sticky;
  top: 20px;
}

```
