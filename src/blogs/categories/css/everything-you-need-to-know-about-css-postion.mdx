To apply css postion you need to use `position` property. 
4 property to manipulate the position.
  - top
  - bottom
  - left
  - right

There are 5 types of css position.

## Static

Static position is the default behaviour. It is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page.

Note: header should be `static`. Sorry my mistake.

```html
  <h1>static</h1>
  <div class="outer__parent">outer parent
    <div class="parent">parent
	 <div class="children">children</div>
    </div>
  </div>
```

```css
  * {
    color: #fff;
  }
  h1 {
    color: #000;
    font-size: 2rem;
    margin-bottom: 2rem;
  }
  .outer__parent {
    background: #00f;
    width: 50vw;
    height: 50vh;
    padding: 1rem;
    font-size: 1.5rem;
  }
  .parent {
    background: #f00;
    height: 30vh;
    margin-top: 1rem;
  }
  .children {
    background: #0ff;
    height: 10vh;
    color: #000;
    margin-top: 1rem;
  }

```

## Relative
Relative position is almost same as Static position. But you can change the position from its normal position with 4properties mentioned above. Its normal position will be blanked.

```css
  .children {
    background: #0ff;
    height: 10vh;
    color: #000;
    margin-top: 1rem;
    position: relative;
    top: 20px;
    left: 300px;
  }

```

## Absolute
Unlike `relative` position, it will be positioned to relative to its nearest relative parent. If it doesn't find any, then it will be positioned to document body. It will be removed from the flow of the webpage. It will be also be scrolled with other elements.

 without relative parent
```css
  .children {
    background: #0ff;
    height: 10vh;
    color: #000;
    margin-top: 1rem;
    position: absolute;
    top: 20px;
    left: 300px;
  }

```

with relative parent
```css 
  .parent {
    background: #f00;
    height: 30vh;
    margin-top: 1rem;
    position: relative;
  }
  .children {
    background: #0ff;
    height: 10vh;
    color: #000;
    margin-top: 1rem;
    position: absolute;
    top: 20px;
    left: 300px;
  }

```

## Fixed
`fixed` is similar to `absolute` with some difference. It will be positioned relative to document body. It will stay fixed inside viewport and will never be scrolled.

```css
  .children {
    background: #0ff;
    height: 10vh;
    color: #000;
    margin-top: 1rem;
    position: fixed;
    top: 20px;
    left: 15%;
  }
```

## Sticky
A sticky element toggles between `relative` and `fixed`. It will be stayed at `relative` first. When it will be scrolled down or up, it will met an offset(the position that you will give). Then it turn it to fix. If the parent is passed from the viewport it will also be scrolled. If the parent is the document body. Then it will always stays fixed.

  .children {

  height: 10vh;
  color: #000;
  margin-top: 1rem;
  position: sticky;
  top: 20px;
}
